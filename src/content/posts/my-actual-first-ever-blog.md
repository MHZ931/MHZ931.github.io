After a few years of trend of doing personal blogs dying down, I finally decided to actually get myself a personal blog. Following [this cool guide](https://mh-n.github.io/guides/github-pages/) and finding this [very cool template](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari), I played around with JavaScript magic (and its **several!** frameworks) a bit and changed most of the stuffs such that everything suits my own flair. And I understood absolutely nothing! But hey, at the very least, we're off with a good start, aren't we?

So for the record, I have to ask myself a question: 

**Why do I do this?**

 Well it's because I wanna actually put some stuffs on github I'm interested in. Plus, it's also a neat little tracking tool for my personal projects. Also sometimes when I have some weird ideas or simply just want to write something (or vent?), I finally have somewhere to dump in. So, win-win-win, I guess?

 Anyway, if you're one of the first persons walking into this blog, welcome! and it's still mostly under construction! But don't worry, I'll fill in the contents, eventually (when I'm feeling it, of course).
